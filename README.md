# softObstacleDetection
soft obstacles (trees and fences) recognition with openCV

1 - Obstacle image Detection, using HOG (Histogram of oriented gradients) feature descriptor and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification algotirhm

2 - Obstacle real-time Detection, using haar cascade algorithm (https://github.com/mrnugget/opencv-haar-classifier-training) and computing distance to camera procedure
